# Hi, I'm Tim Thoithi

### Full-Stack Developer & DevOps Engineer

## About Me

I’m a passionate builder—always seeking elegant, efficient solutions. My journey started back in high school (2017), and I’ve worked my way from classic web dev to modern DevOps, all on the trusty HP Elitebook 8440p, with some upgrades. I thrive working with lightweight stacks like Flask + SQLite, but I’ve also explored the world of React, Node, and cloud orchestration because versatility matters.

- **2025 Graduate:** Bachelor’s in Business Information Technology (Sept 2021 – Apr 2025)
- **DevOps Engineer:** Moringa School (Jun 2025 – Aug 2025)
- **Self-taught & Curious:** Most of my work is self-driven, not commercial—recently, I’ve gone deep into DevOps pipelines, containerization, and cloud deployments.

Away from the terminal, you’ll find me sketching graffiti, mastering calligraphy, or playing basketball as a versatile two-way guard. I’m also fluent in German and Spanish—language learning is another of my lifelong passions.

I’ve never sought the spotlight, but I’m proud of the solutions I’ve built and the skills I’ve grown. Connect with me if you love robust systems, creative art, or just want to swap stories about learning and building from scratch!
